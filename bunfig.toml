# Root-level Bun configuration
# Excludes UI folder from Bun test discovery
# UI module uses Vitest, not Bun test runner
# CLI and Core modules use Bun test runner

[test]
# Exclude UI folder from test discovery and coverage
# This tells Bun to ignore the entire ui directory when discovering tests
coveragePathIgnorePatterns = [
  "ui/**"
]

# Note: The Bun extension should respect the ui/.vscode/settings.json 
# where "bun.enable": false is set, but if it doesn't, this bunfig.toml
# configuration should help exclude the ui folder from test discovery
